# How to contribute
Some projects might have their own readme or cintributions.md, so maybe, if you like the project and want some stretch-goals, have a look there first.

In general you can just fork this repo, make a small change anywhere and send a pull request. It would be aboslutely okay if that change is only a typo for example, since this repository's main purpose is to get you going with Git(Hub) and its workflow(s).


## Project structure
- category (for example 3-JS-starter)
  - project-name
    - user-name
      - project files
      
## workflow
- Fork this repo
- Add your project folder named as \<your-user-name> inside \<project-name>
- Make a pull request
