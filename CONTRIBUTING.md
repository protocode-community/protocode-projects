# How to contribute
Some projects might have their own readme or cintributions.md, so maybe, if you like the project and want some stretch-goals, have a look there first.

In general you can just fork this repo, make a small change anywhere and send a pull request. It would be aboslutely okay if that change is only a typo for example, since this repository's main purpose is to get you going with Git(Hub) and its workflow(s).


## Project structure
- category (for example 3-JS-starter)
  - project-name
    - user-name
      - project files
      
## workflow
- Fork this repo
- Add your project folder named as \<your-user-name> inside \<project-name>
- Make a pull request

## Update your fork
if you forked it already a while ago, don't forget to update your fork.

In Mai 2021 GitHub has introduced a feature to sync a fork with the click of a button: [GitHub's tweet](https://twitter.com/github/status/1390382527588798477)

- Go to your fork, click on `Fetch upstream`
- Click on Fetch and merge to directly sync your fork with its parent repo

You may also click on the Compare button to compare the changes before merging.
